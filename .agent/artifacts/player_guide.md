### Military:
- Knights are expensive but worth it (30 strength each)

- Risky contracts pay more but may cause casualties
- Level up units through easy contracts first

### Religious:
- Monasteries give +2 karma/day (passive karma generation)
- Preach at large cities for maximum follower gain
- Save karma for Prosperity blessing (best ROI)
- Temples spread faith automatically (passive followers)

### General:
- Visit settlements often (trade, recruit, preach all available)

2. **Ignoring upkeep:** Army without gold = desertion
3. **Building too fast:** Properties need time to pay off
4. **Forgetting to preach:** Free followers at every settlement
5. **Not using miracles:** Karma is meant to be spent
6. **Overextending army:** Quality > quantity

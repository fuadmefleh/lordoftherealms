## Economy Tips

### Maximizing Production
1. **Settle near resources**: Resources within 2 hexes provide bonuses
2. **Multiple resources stack**: Nearby resources give 50% of their bonus
3. **Population matters**: Larger populations produce more
4. **Trade routes**: Establish routes between settlements for extra gold

### Food Management
- Each person consumes 0.1 food/day
- Surplus food → population growth (max 0.1%/day)
- Severe shortage → population decline (0.1%/day)

### Trade Route Profit
- Base profit: 50 gold
- Distance penalty: ÷ (1 + distance × 0.1)
- Example: Distance 10 = 50 ÷ 2 = 25 gold/day
